# Flipkart-Air-Conditioner-Sales-Analysis
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of air conditioners listed on Flipkart using a dataset obtained through web scraping. After thorough data cleaning, which included handling missing values, converting data types, and standardizing numeric columns, I delved into various aspects of the dataset. I calculated the average rating of all air conditioners, identified the highest and lowest discount prices, counted the number of air conditioners with high discounts, displayed ACs with lower ratings and their actual prices, visualized the distribution of discount prices, showcased ACs with top ratings and their discount prices, determined the quantity of ACs with ratings between 3 and 4, listed ACs with specific ratings and discounts, displayed high-priced ACs with the best ratings, and finally, extracted the number of ratings for a specific AC model. Through this project, I successfully derived valuable insights into the pricing, ratings, and discounts of air conditioners available on Flipkart.
